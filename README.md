## Predicting Movie Genre Performance Based on Economic Factors

### Abstract

Throughout the 21st century the dominance of superhero, sci-fi, and fantasy genres has increased significantly with films like “The Avengers” or “Star Wars” breaking box office records on a frequent basis.  This phenomenon begs the question of whether or not this is simply a shift culturally or if it is influenced by measurable outside factors such as the state of the economy.  More specifically, our goal with this study is to see if there exists any sort of predictive power between movie trends and socioeconomic factors that would allow us to more accurately predict movie revenue over a specific time frame.  We will be using gross domestic movie theatre revenue by month to represent the demand by genre and national economic statistics (such as consumer price index changes or weekly average earnings) to represent the current socio-economic state.
